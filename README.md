# SIR-model-with-interventions

I use the simplest SIR model to try to assess some modelling issues regarding the nature of social distancing and testing interventions.

Social distancing is implemented by applying a correcting factor to the beta parameter of the SIR model.

Testing is implemented by applying a correcting factor to the gamma parameter of the SIR model.

I am not sure it is easy to interpret the correcting factors in terms of actual public health interventions. The notebook is mostly intended to provide a simple model that can be used to generate ideas.

I repeated this approach with the SEIQR model developed by Caroline, re-programmed in python.
